# TravelGuide_using_Dijkstra
Created a travel guide using DSA course concepts inspired by the course project on greedy algorithm and friend's Europe tour plans. Initially, I used my country's cities for the course capstone project. The uploaded project modifies that into various locations throughout Europe and the UK that my friend planned to visit using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
This code allows me to view the shortest path to a destination city from my current location and lets me also know the total distance it will take.
The distances taken into measurement for the database are from Google Maps in 2023. Any updated distances in case of new road/infrastructural development since then haven't been accounted for.
