# TravelGuide_using_Dijkstra
Created a travel guide using DSA course concepts inspired by the course project on greedy algorithm and friend's Europe tour plans. Initially, I used my country's cities for the course capstone project. The uploaded project modifies that into various locations throughout Europe and the UK that my friend planned to visit using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
